# AWS - Lex Chat Bot 

The screenshots and code included in this repo are for a configuration of a chatbot (Lex) through AWS to advise on how to invest money for retirement. 

The combination of the "lex" portion of the aws program is not communicating correctly with the "lambda" function in AWS at this time, but screenshots and code are provided in the repo.
